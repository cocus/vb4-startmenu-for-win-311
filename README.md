# vb4-startmenu-for-win-311
This is a work in progress project to emulate the start menu of Windows 9x inside Win 3.x. More or less like calmira, but with a more user friendly approach.

# Status
It's still in pre-alpha, but at least it can load the items from a .grp file, with its corresponding icons and text and list them in a form. 
That list also works like a menu, so it can highlight (only with the mouse for now) the items and it can start the selected item after a click.
