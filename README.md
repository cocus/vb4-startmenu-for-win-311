# vb6-metroslider
VB6 UserControl: MetroSlider, mimicks the sliders (scrollbars) used in Win10 Metro apps. Works on DWM-framed windows.

# Status
It's still in pre-alpha, but at least it can load the items from a .grp file, with its corresponding icons and text and list them in a form. 
That list also works like a menu, so it can highlight (only with the mouse for now) the items and it can start the selected item after a click.
